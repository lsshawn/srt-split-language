1
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,900
嗨! 大家好，我Jiun
Hi everyone, my name is Jiun.

2
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:07,424
感謝你找到我的頻道並觀看我的視頻
Welcome to my channel and thank you for watching my video. 

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,520
今天我們不打皂我們來聊一聊火山爆發!
Today we are going to talk about Volcano Eruption!

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,396
耶耶耶！大家先不要急著退出影片！
Don't skip this video yet!

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,696
你們沒有來錯地方
You are at the right place,

6
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:25,088
這裡依然是講述有關手工皂的 YouTube Channel
we are still a YouTube Channel for handmade soap. 

7
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,295
可是今天要講的火山爆發
But the "volcano eruption" that we will be talking about today

8
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:28,695
不是這種
is not this type of volcano eruption

9
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:29,952
而是這一種
but Soap Volcano. 

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,761
我在之前製作家事皂的影片裡就答應過大家
In my previous video of making household soap, 

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,864
會專門製作一期影片來和大家說一說
I promised everyone that I will be making a special episode to talk about

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,760
為什麼手工皂會裂開
why does handmade soap crack, 

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,992
尤其是家事皂真的特別容易會裂開
especially household soap. 

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,544
而我們又要如何避免這個問題呢？
But how do we overcome this problem? 

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,872
那在開始講述之前那我先帶大家去看一看照片
Before we begin, let's take a look at some photos

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,944
讓大家有個概念到底肥皂火山爆發
So that everyone has an idea of 

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
長什麼樣子
how Soap Volcano looks like

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,272
首先我們來到谷歌大神的家
First, we come to Google 

19
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,423
搜索關鍵詞Soap Volcano
type the keywords "Soap Volcano" on the search bar.

20
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:58,058
你也可以用中文搜索
You can also search the keywords in Mandarin,

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:58,656
肥皂裂開

22
00:00:58,689 --> 00:00:59,822
肥皂火山爆發

23
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,720
之類的關鍵詞也能找到相關圖片
These keywords can also help you to find relevant pictures.

24
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,816
可是如果使用英文搜索的話能找到更多相關圖片
But you can find more relevant pictures using English keywords.

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
我們先來看看這張圖片
First let us take a look at this photo.

26
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
肥皂表面完全裂開
The surface of the soap is totally cracked. 

27
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
裡面的肥皂快要噴發出來
The soap is about to volcano out of the mold. 

28
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,285
現在大家明白
Now you understand

29
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:20,384
為什麼我們稱這個現象為肥皂火山爆發了吧？
why this phenomenon is known as Soap Volcano right? 

30
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
我們再看看第2張圖片
Now look at the second picture.

31
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
這個呢就更嚴重了
This is more serious,

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,416
皂液就像火山岩漿一樣全部噴灑出來
the soap is blasting out of the mold like lava.

33
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
接下來我們看看第3張圖片
Next we look at the third picture.

34
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
這個現像我們稱之為Alien Brain
We call this phenomenon as Alien Brain.  

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,496
因為他的皺褶看起來就有點像外星人的腦袋
Because the wrinkles on the top make the surface looks like alien's brain.

36
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,179
那他形成的原因呢
I will explain 

37
00:01:48,313 --> 00:01:50,080
我待會也會一起告訴大家
the cause of this phenomenon later. 

38
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,565
那接下來這張圖片呢
The next picture here is what happened in my last video,

39
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:56,480
是我之前製作家事皂影片時出現的裂開狀況
the household soap was cracked on top.

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
拍攝這張照片時
When I took this picture, 

41
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
肥皂還在皂化中
the soap was still in saponification. 

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,112
中間那一圈就是果凍
This is the Gel Phase. 

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,009
而這張圖片呢
But this picture here

44
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:06,464
就是肥皂完全皂化後的樣子
shows how the soap looks like after saponification. 

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
果凍消失了
The gel phase disappears, 

46
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
只剩下中間的裂痕
left with a huge crack at the center. 

47
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
那待會我會告訴大家我做了哪個舉動
Later I will tell you some of the steps 

48
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
讓我在製作第2次時
I have taken during the 2nd time of making the soap

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
使用了同樣的配方和模具
using the same ingredients and mold

50
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
可是卻沒有裂開
and it did not crack. 

51
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,173
完美大成功！
An absolute success!

52
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,848
那剛才我們看到了三個不同程度的裂開現象
So just now we have seen three different degrees of cracked soap tops.

53
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
雖然第3張圖他沒有裂開
Although the soap in the third picture did not crack,

54
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,992
可是它產生皺紋的原因是一樣的
but the cause for its wrinkles is the same as cracked soap top, 


55
00:02:27,992 --> 00:02:30,272
所以我就在這里和大家一起講述
so I will explain them altogether. 

56
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,880
那造成肥皂裂開和產生Alien Brain的原因都是同一個
So cracked soap tops and Alien Brain are caused by the same problem

57
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:35,736
那就是
which is 

58
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,670
高溫
overheating.

59
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:39,488
如果你有製作手工皂的經驗你應該有發覺到
If you have experience in making handmade soap, 

60
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,002
當皂液入模以後的30分鐘至一小時以後
you might realize that after filling the mold with soap for 30 minutes to 1 hour

61
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:47,168
當你再去觸碰模具時你能感覺到他是溫熱的
the mold container will feels hot. 

62
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,752
那是因為肥皂在皂化過程中會升溫發熱
This is because the soap continues to heat up during saponification. 

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,568
而如果溫度實在是飆升得太高
and if the temperature gets too high, 

64
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,366
就會造成火山爆發
it will cause Soap Volcano. 

65
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,432
那由於肥皂的周圍都有模具包圍著
The soap is enclosed within the mold

66
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
只有表面能散熱
where heat can only escape via the top surface.

67
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,865
所以肥皂裂開的地方
So the soap usually cracks

68
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,296
都在肥皂表面
on the top surface. 

69
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,364
那到底有哪些原因導致肥皂溫度過高
So what are the other reasons that cause overheating

70
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:08,416
進而引起火山爆發呢？
leading to Soap Volcano? 

71
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,309
主要原因有四個
There are 4 main reasons, 

72
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:13,280
第一：油鹼混合時溫度太高
Firstly, the temperature of lye solution and oils was too high during mixing. 

73
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,864
第二：你使用的模具有很好的保溫效果
Secondly, the mold you are using has very good heat insulating properties. 

74
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
第三
Thirdly, 

75
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,194
當皂液入模以後你把他放在一個保溫效果很好的地方
you put the soap in places with thermal insulation after it is molded. 

76
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,327
例如：保溫箱或是烤箱
For instance, cooler box or oven. 

77
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:28,128
第四：你使用了某些帶有升溫效果的添加物
Lastly, you used additives that produce heat naturally. 

78
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
例如：含有蛋白質的添加物
For example, additives that contain protein,

79
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,391
牛奶、羊奶、母乳和豆漿這些都算
including cow milk, goat milk, breastmilk and soy milk. 

80
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:34,892
含有糖分的添加物
And high natural sugar ingredients,

81
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:36,064
例如：蜂蜜
such as honey. 

82
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,099
含有酒精成分的添加物
Additives that contain alcohol

83
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,989
例如大家很喜歡製作的啤酒皂和紅酒皂
that can be found in the popular beer and wine soaps

84
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:43,190
還有就是某些精油和香精
and some fragrance oils or essential oils 

85
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,024
也會導致溫度上升
can also cause the temperature of soap to rise. 

86
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,096
那根據我之前使用的經驗與大家分享
Based on my previous experience, 

87
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,960
大部分花類的香精或精油都會造成皂液升溫的效果
most floral fragrance oils or essential oils  will cause the rise in temperature of soap. 

88
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
當然這不僅此於花類的精油或香精
But of course it is not only limited to floral essential oils or fragrance oils, 

89
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,640
其他類別的精油或香精也是有可能會導致溫度上升的
other essential oils or fragrance oils might also cause the temperature to rise. 

90
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,686
那由於精油和香精的品牌和類別實在是太多
But there are countless of essential oils and fragrance oils in the market

91
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,528
而且他們成分複雜
and they have complicated ingredients,

92
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,851
我在這裡無法為大家一一舉出
so I cannot list them out one-by-one in this video. 

93
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,135
而且我本身也並不是專業的香氛師
Plus I am not a professional perfumer or fragrance expert. 

94
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,488
我只是根據我之前使用的經驗與大家分享
I can only share my knowledge based on my past experience, 

95
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,016
那如果有什麼遺漏的地方歡迎大家留言補充
so feel free to comment down below if you have anything to add on. 

96
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,749
那接下來我們來講一下
So now let's us talk about 

97
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:24,191
到底要如何避免肥皂裂開或是火山爆發
how to prevent cracked soap tops or Soap Volcano. 

98
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
一共有6點要和大家分享
There are 6 points to share with you: 

99
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,591
第一：油鹼混合時把溫度控制在30°c左右
Number 1: Keep the temperature of the mixture of lye solutions and oils around 30 degree celsius.

100
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,833
溫度相差兩三度沒關係
Slight difference in temperature should be fine,

101
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,207
可是如果你是製作家事皂的話
but if you are making household soap, 

102
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:37,679
最好把溫度控制在30°c以下
it is best to keep the temperature below 30 degree celsius. 

103
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,646
第二：選用保溫效果比較低的模具
Number 2: choose a less insulating mold. 

104
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:42,623
例如：比較薄的矽膠模
For instance, silicone molds with thinner walls

105
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
或是沒有木盒的吐司模
or non-wood loaf mold. 

106
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,535
第三：如果是在夏天的話皂液入模以後可以選擇不要保溫
Number 3: you can choose not to insulate your newly-molded soap during the summer

107
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,351
然後把肥皂放在一個通風涼爽的地方
and put it at a dry and cool place if needed. 

108
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,452
第四點：
Number 4:

109
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:55,976
避免使用帶有升溫效果的添加物
Avoid using naturally heat-producing additives,

110
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:57,727
就是我們之前提到的那些
the ones we mentioned previously,

111
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
帶有蛋白質成分
those ingredients that contain protein,

112 
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,019
糖分
sugar,

113
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,567
還有酒精成分的材料
and alcohol, 

114
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
還有某些香精和精油
as well as some essential oils or fragrance oils. 

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
第五點：把水量的倍數拉高
Number 5: increase the ratio of water

116
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
或是把軟油的比例拉高
or increase the ratio of soft oils.

117
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,115
當水量增加皂化的速度就會變慢
When the amount of water increases, the saponification process will get slower

118
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,599
那升溫的速度也會跟著放慢
and the heating process will also become slower, 

119
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
也就沒那麼容易裂開了
thus reducing the likelihood of cracking. 

120
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,403
可是如果水量太多的話肥皂就會偏軟噢
However, the soap will get overly soft if you add too much water. 

121
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,337
大家也要把這一點考慮進去
Please take this into consideration as well. 

122
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:22,047
而如果增加軟油比例
But if you increase the ratio of soft oils, 

123
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
那肥皂就沒有那麼硬
the soap will not be too hardened, 

124
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,119
也就沒那麼容易裂開了
and it will not crack easily. 

125
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,875
第六
Number 6:

126
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,502
如果你是製作高比例椰子油手工皂
If you are making handmade soap with high proportion of coconut oil,

127
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:30,239
例如：椰子油家事皂
for instance, coconut oil household soap. 

128
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:31,519
那你就可以考慮
Then you can consider

129
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,055
打開電風扇對著他
cooling the soap using electronic fan. 

130
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:36,334
又或是放進冰箱的冷藏區幫助降溫
Or you can put the soap into the fridge to help it cool down. 

131
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,734
也就是放蔬菜水果的那一區
It's the compartment of the fridge where you put your fruits and vegetables, 

132
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:39,967
那大家要注意哦！
please take note!

133
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
我這裡說的是高比例的椰子油手工皂配方
The example I am giving here is the handmade soap with high proportion of coconut oil

134
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,879
並不是所有的手工皂配方都放入冰箱裡做降溫
which means not all handmade soaps are suitable to be placed into fridge for cooling. 

135
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,183
例如手工皂的配方裡
For instance, 

136
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,264
椰子油的比例佔有80%至100%
if the proportion of coconut oil is around 80% to 100% in a soap, 

137
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:53,535
就屬於高比例
then the proportion is considered high. 

138
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
因為在眾多手工皂配方裡
Among all the handmade soap recipes, 

139
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
高比椰子油的配方
the coconut oil recipe 

140
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,191
是最容易引起火山爆發或是裂開的
is most likely to cause cracked tops or Soap Volcano. 

141
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,695
因為椰子油的硬度很高、皂化速度快、升溫速度也快
Coconut oil is considered a hard oil which induces fast saponification and speeds up the heating process.


142
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:07,615
如果你是製作100%椰子油家事皂
If you are making a 100% coconut oil household soap, 

143
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
那配方裡就完全沒有軟油
the recipe does not contain soft oil at all. 

144
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,991
如果再配上一個保溫效果很好的模具
And if you use a mold with good thermal insulating properties...

145
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,706
大家聽到我說把肥皂放入冰箱裡降溫
You might think that it's weird

146
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:25,924
可能會覺得很奇怪
to put soap into the fridge for cooling,

147
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,839
尤其是亞洲的打皂人
especially for Asian soapmakers. 

148
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:30,655
可是在西方國家這是很普遍的做法
But this is actually a very common method in Western countries. 

149
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,831
我本身也測試過這個方法
I myself have tried this method

150
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:35,263
而我的家事皂也健康的順產了
and my household soap was successfully made. 

151
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,871
那在西方國家和我們東方國家的打皂方法上
There are indeed some differences in soap making methods

152
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
的確是有某些地方的差異
between Western and Eastern countries. 

153
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,621
例如在西方國家他們會把烤箱預熱以後
For instance, Western soapmakers usually preheat the oven, 

154
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,520
關火
turn off the oven

155
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:48,831
然後把肥皂放入烤箱裡做保溫
and then only place the soap into oven to keep it warm. 

156
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,671
可是在我們這裡呢一般是使用保溫箱做保溫
However, we Asians usually use cooler box to keep the soap warm。

157
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
保溫的話
To keep the soap warm,

158
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,719
就放入烤箱
we put it into the oven. 

159
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
降溫的話
For cooling purposes, 

160
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
就放入冰箱
we put it into the fridge.

161
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
沒毛病啊！
There's no problem at all!

162
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,935
那大家如果覺得好奇以上方法的話可以親自測試看看
You can try it yourself if you are interested, 

163
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,502
可是記得安全第一
but remember safety comes first. 

164
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:08,287
要搜索好資料做好功課才去測試
Do sufficient research before trying out this method. 

165
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,416
那我再和大家仔細的說一下
Now I will have to further explain 

166
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:11,804
剛才我提到的方法
the method that I have mentioned earlier

167
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:13,919
大家需要靈活變通的去使用
requires certain flexibility and adaptibility. 

168
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
畢竟每個人生活的環境都不一樣
Since everyone has different living conditions,

169
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,575
必須要根據當下的氣溫、氣候還有個人使用的模具
you have to make adjustments 

170
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
去做調整
according to your surrounding temperature, climate and the soap making tools you use.

171
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,746
為了讓大家有更好的理解
To give you a better idea, 

172
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,746
我在這裡為大家舉幾個例子
I will provide a few examples. 

173
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,779
如果說現在是在夏天
For instance, imagine it's summer now

174
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,678
而你的油鹼溫度是在40°c左右
and your soap mixture is around 40 degrees celsius, 

175
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:33,944
在這麼炎熱的夏天這麼高的油鹼溫度
then your soap is very likely to crack 

176
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,111
肥皂是很容易會裂開的
under such high temperatures. 

177
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:39,477
那在這時你可以選用一些比較薄的模具
Now you can choose to use molds with thinner walls

178
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,176
皂液入模以後選擇不要保溫
and choose not to insulate the newly-molded soap. 

179
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:43,241
因為據我所知
Because according to what I know, 

180
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:44,127
有些皂友
some of the soapmaker

181
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:47,208
是喜歡使用40°c左右的溫度去打皂的
like to make soap under the temperature of around 40 degrees celsius. 

182
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,223
那這時
By this time, 

183
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,808
你並不需要強逼自己改掉這個習慣
you don't have to force yourself to change this habit

184
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:52,907
去把溫度降至30°c
by reducing the temperature to 30 degrees celsius. 

185
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,940
而是可以在模具、水量
You can choose to make adjustments on 

186
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,740
或是皂液入模以後放置肥皂的地方去做調整
the type of mold, the water portion and the storage place after molding. 

187
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,553
那如果說現在是在寒冷的冬天
But imagine it's winter now, 

188
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:04,607
而你唯一的模具是這種薄薄的模具
and the only mold you have is thin-walled mold, 

189
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:05,887
那又該怎麼辦呢？
what should you do then? 

190
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,471
那你可以從一開始就把油鹼溫度控制在高一些
You can keep the temperature of soap mixture higher in the beginning of soapmaking process

191
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
添加一些牛奶幫助升溫
or add some milk to help raise the temperature

192
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
皂液入模以後放入保溫箱做保溫
and put the mold into cooler box to keep it warm. 

193
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
可是如果你使用的模具是這種比較厚的模具
However, if you use this type of mold with thicker walls 

194
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
而且還是帶蓋子的
and with wonden box and lid

195
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
那你可以選擇不要保溫也是可以的
then you can choose not to insulate the soap. 

196
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
我用家事皂再舉一個例子
I will give one more example of household soap

197
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,695
因為家事皂實在是很容易裂開
because household soap really cracks easily

198
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:32,511
尤其是對於新手來說每次遇到都手足無措
which is especially challenging for newbies.

199
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,832
如果你製作家事皂使用的模具
If the mold you use for making household soap 

200
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:36,699
是這種比較單薄的模具
is a thin-walled mold like this

201
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:39,679
又或是這種PP5的塑料盒
or a PP5 plastic container like this

202
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
他們的散熱效果都很好
they have very good heat dissipating properties, 

203
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
所以一般情況下是不會裂開的
so the soap will not crack easily under such conditions

204
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
所以也就不需要放入冰箱裡降溫了
and there is no need to put the soap into fridge for cooling. 

205
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:51,199
可是如果你製作家事皂是使用這種保溫性很好的模具
But if you use mold with good insulating properties like this, 

206
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
那裂開的可能性是蠻高的
there is a high possibility of soap cracking. 

207
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
那這時呢你可以考慮
Now you can consider 

208
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,645
當皂液入模以後
to cool down the soap 

209
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:59,487
把他放入冰箱的冷藏區做降溫
by putting it into the fridge

210
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:01,695
又或是開著電風扇吹著他
or placing it in front of a fan. 

211
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:05,915
當然你也需要把你當下的環境溫度考慮進去
Of course you have to take your surrounding temperature into account

212
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:07,327
需不需要做這個舉動
to see if it's necessary to exercise this step. 

213
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,704
製作手工皂的程序看似簡單
The steps for making handmade soap might seem easy, 

214
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:13,215
可是當中的細節和原理才是需要我們深入的去學習
but there are a lot of details and principles that we need to take into account. 

215
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
那進步最好的方法
The best way to improve 

216
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
就是多練習
is to practice regularly 


217
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
又或者是多來看看我的影片
or watch more of my videos. 


218
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,663
那你們喜歡這一類純分享手工皂知識的影片嗎？
