00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,900
Hi everyone, my name is Jiun.

2
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:07,424
Welcome to my channel and thank you for watching my video.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,520
Today we are going to talk about Volcano Eruption!

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,396
Don't skip this video yet!

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,696
You are at the right place,

6
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:25,088
we are still a YouTube Channel for handmade soap.

7
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,295
But the "volcano eruption" that we will be talking about today

8
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:28,695
is not this type of volcano eruption

9
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:29,952
but Soap Volcano.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,761
In my previous video of making household soap,

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,864
I promised everyone that I will be making a special episode to talk about

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,760
why does handmade soap crack,

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,992
especially household soap.

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,544
But how do we overcome this problem?

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,872
Before we begin, let's take a look at some photos

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,944
So that everyone has an idea of

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
how Soap Volcano looks like

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,272
First, we come to Google

19
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,423
type the keywords "Soap Volcano" on the search bar.

20
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:58,058
You can also search the keywords in Mandarin,

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:58,656

22
00:00:58,689 --> 00:00:59,822

23
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,720
These keywords can also help you to find relevant pictures.

24
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,816
But you can find more relevant pictures using English keywords.

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
First let us take a look at this photo.

26
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
The surface of the soap is totally cracked.

27
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
The soap is about to volcano out of the mold.

28
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,285
Now you understand

29
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:20,384
why this phenomenon is known as Soap Volcano right?

30
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
Now look at the second picture.

31
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
This is more serious,

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,416
the soap is blasting out of the mold like lava.

33
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
Next we look at the third picture.

34
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
We call this phenomenon as Alien Brain.

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,496
Because the wrinkles on the top make the surface looks like alien's brain.

36
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,179
I will explain

37
00:01:48,313 --> 00:01:50,080
the cause of this phenomenon later.

38
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,565
The next picture here is what happened in my last video,

39
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:56,480
the household soap was cracked on top.

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
When I took this picture,

41
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
the soap was still in saponification.

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,112
This is the Gel Phase.

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,009
But this picture here

44
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:06,464
shows how the soap looks like after saponification.

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
The gel phase disappears,

46
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
left with a huge crack at the center.

47
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
Later I will tell you some of the steps

48
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
I have taken during the 2nd time of making the soap

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
using the same ingredients and mold

50
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
and it did not crack.

51
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,173
An absolute success!

52
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,848
So just now we have seen three different degrees of cracked soap tops.

53
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
Although the soap in the third picture did not crack,

54
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,992
but the cause for its wrinkles is the same as cracked soap top,

55
00:02:27,992 --> 00:02:30,272
so I will explain them altogether.

56
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,880
So cracked soap tops and Alien Brain are caused by the same problem

57
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:35,736
which is

58
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,670
overheating.

59
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:39,488
If you have experience in making handmade soap,

60
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,002
you might realize that after filling the mold with soap for 30 minutes to 1 hour

61
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:47,168
the mold container will feels hot.

62
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,752
This is because the soap continues to heat up during saponification.

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,568
and if the temperature gets too high,

64
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,366
it will cause Soap Volcano.

65
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,432
The soap is enclosed within the mold

66
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
where heat can only escape via the top surface.

67
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,865
So the soap usually cracks

68
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,296
on the top surface.

69
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,364
So what are the other reasons that cause overheating

70
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:08,416
leading to Soap Volcano?

71
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,309
There are 4 main reasons,

72
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:13,280
Firstly, the temperature of lye solution and oils was too high during mixing.

73
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,864
Secondly, the mold you are using has very good heat insulating properties.

74
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Thirdly,

75
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,194
you put the soap in places with thermal insulation after it is molded.

76
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,327
For instance, cooler box or oven.

77
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:28,128
Lastly, you used additives that produce heat naturally.

78
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
For example, additives that contain protein,

79
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,391
including cow milk, goat milk, breastmilk and soy milk.

80
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:34,892
And high natural sugar ingredients,

81
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:36,064
such as honey.

82
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,099
Additives that contain alcohol

83
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,989
that can be found in the popular beer and wine soaps

84
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:43,190
and some fragrance oils or essential oils

85
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,024
can also cause the temperature of soap to rise.

86
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,096
Based on my previous experience,

87
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,960
most floral fragrance oils or essential oils  will cause the rise in temperature of soap.

88
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
But of course it is not only limited to floral essential oils or fragrance oils,

89
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,640
other essential oils or fragrance oils might also cause the temperature to rise.

90
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,686
But there are countless of essential oils and fragrance oils in the market

91
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,528
and they have complicated ingredients,

92
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,851
so I cannot list them out one-by-one in this video.

93
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,135
Plus I am not a professional perfumer or fragrance expert.

94
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,488
I can only share my knowledge based on my past experience,

95
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,016
so feel free to comment down below if you have anything to add on.

96
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,749
So now let's us talk about

97
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:24,191
how to prevent cracked soap tops or Soap Volcano.

98
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
There are 6 points to share with you:

99
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,591
Number 1: Keep the temperature of the mixture of lye solutions and oils around 30 degree celsius.

100
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,833
Slight difference in temperature should be fine,

101
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,207
but if you are making household soap,

102
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:37,679
it is best to keep the temperature below 30 degree celsius.

103
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,646
Number 2: choose a less insulating mold.

104
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:42,623
For instance, silicone molds with thinner walls

105
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
or non-wood loaf mold.

106
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,535
Number 3: you can choose not to insulate your newly-molded soap during the summer

107
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,351
and put it at a dry and cool place if needed.

108
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,452
Number 4:

109
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:55,976
Avoid using naturally heat-producing additives,

110
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:57,727
the ones we mentioned previously,

111
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
those ingredients that contain protein,

112
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,019
sugar,

113
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,567
and alcohol,

114
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
as well as some essential oils or fragrance oils.

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
Number 5: increase the ratio of water

116
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
or increase the ratio of soft oils.

117
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,115
When the amount of water increases, the saponification process will get slower

118
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,599
and the heating process will also become slower,

119
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
thus reducing the likelihood of cracking.

120
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,403
However, the soap will get overly soft if you add too much water.

121
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,337
Please take this into consideration as well.

122
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:22,047
But if you increase the ratio of soft oils,

123
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
the soap will not be too hardened,

124
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,119
and it will not crack easily.

125
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,875
Number 6:

126
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,502
If you are making handmade soap with high proportion of coconut oil,

127
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:30,239
for instance, coconut oil household soap.

128
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:31,519
Then you can consider

129
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,055
cooling the soap using electronic fan.

130
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:36,334
Or you can put the soap into the fridge to help it cool down.

131
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,734
It's the compartment of the fridge where you put your fruits and vegetables,

132
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:39,967
please take note!

133
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
The example I am giving here is the handmade soap with high proportion of coconut oil

134
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,879
which means not all handmade soaps are suitable to be placed into fridge for cooling.

135
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,183
For instance,

136
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,264
if the proportion of coconut oil is around 80% to 100% in a soap,

137
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:53,535
then the proportion is considered high.

138
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
Among all the handmade soap recipes,

139
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
the coconut oil recipe

140
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,191
is most likely to cause cracked tops or Soap Volcano.

141
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,695
Coconut oil is considered a hard oil which induces fast saponification and speeds up the heating process.

142
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:07,615
If you are making a 100% coconut oil household soap,

143
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
the recipe does not contain soft oil at all.

144
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,991
And if you use a mold with good thermal insulating properties...

145
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,706
You might think that it's weird

146
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:25,924
to put soap into the fridge for cooling,

147
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,839
especially for Asian soapmakers.

148
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:30,655
But this is actually a very common method in Western countries.

149
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,831
I myself have tried this method

150
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:35,263
and my household soap was successfully made.

151
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,871
There are indeed some differences in soap making methods

152
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
between Western and Eastern countries.

153
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,621
For instance, Western soapmakers usually preheat the oven,

154
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,520
turn off the oven

155
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:48,831
and then only place the soap into oven to keep it warm.

156
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,671
However, we Asians usually use cooler box to keep the soap warm。

157
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
To keep the soap warm,

158
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,719
we put it into the oven.

159
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
For cooling purposes,

160
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
we put it into the fridge.

161
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
There's no problem at all!

162
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,935
You can try it yourself if you are interested,

163
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,502
but remember safety comes first.

164
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:08,287
Do sufficient research before trying out this method.

165
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,416
Now I will have to further explain

166
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:11,804
the method that I have mentioned earlier

167
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:13,919
requires certain flexibility and adaptibility.

168
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
Since everyone has different living conditions,

169
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,575
you have to make adjustments

170
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
according to your surrounding temperature, climate and the soap making tools you use.

171
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,746
To give you a better idea,

172
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,746
I will provide a few examples.

173
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,779
For instance, imagine it's summer now

174
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,678
and your soap mixture is around 40 degrees celsius,

175
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:33,944
then your soap is very likely to crack

176
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,111
under such high temperatures.

177
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:39,477
Now you can choose to use molds with thinner walls

178
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,176
and choose not to insulate the newly-molded soap.

179
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:43,241
Because according to what I know,

180
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:44,127
some of the soapmaker

181
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:47,208
like to make soap under the temperature of around 40 degrees celsius.

182
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,223
By this time,

183
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,808
you don't have to force yourself to change this habit

184
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:52,907
by reducing the temperature to 30 degrees celsius.

185
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,940
You can choose to make adjustments on

186
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,740
the type of mold, the water portion and the storage place after molding.

187
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,553
But imagine it's winter now,

188
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:04,607
and the only mold you have is thin-walled mold,

189
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:05,887
what should you do then?

190
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,471
You can keep the temperature of soap mixture higher in the beginning of soapmaking process

191
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
or add some milk to help raise the temperature

192
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
and put the mold into cooler box to keep it warm.

193
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
However, if you use this type of mold with thicker walls

194
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
and with wonden box and lid

195
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
then you can choose not to insulate the soap.

196
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
I will give one more example of household soap

197
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,695
because household soap really cracks easily

198
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:32,511
which is especially challenging for newbies.

199
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,832
If the mold you use for making household soap

200
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:36,699
is a thin-walled mold like this

201
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:39,679
or a PP5 plastic container like this

202
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
they have very good heat dissipating properties,

203
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
so the soap will not crack easily under such conditions

204
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
and there is no need to put the soap into fridge for cooling.

205
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:51,199
But if you use mold with good insulating properties like this,

206
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
there is a high possibility of soap cracking.

207
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
Now you can consider

208
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,645
to cool down the soap

209
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:59,487
by putting it into the fridge

210
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:01,695
or placing it in front of a fan.

211
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:05,915
Of course you have to take your surrounding temperature into account

212
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:07,327
to see if it's necessary to exercise this step.

213
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,704
The steps for making handmade soap might seem easy,

214
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:13,215
but there are a lot of details and principles that we need to take into account.

215
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
The best way to improve

216
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
is to practice regularly

217
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
or watch more of my videos.

218
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,663
Do you like videos of me sharing about soapmaking knowledge?
